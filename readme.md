## Overview

<!-- TODO: To be changed -->
<!-- The following are just sample -->
Description of the project in details.

Guiding Question:
- What is the project?
<br /> The project is about creating a header and footer display website using HTML and CSS.
- Whats the purpose
<br> In website design, headers and footers fulfill several functions: they guarantee design consistency, offer contact and legal information, accessibility features, branding, and navigation. The user experience, aesthetics, and usability are all improved when they are made with HTML and CSS.
- What are key components
<br /> Branding components including logos, search bars, navigation menus, contact details, and social networking connections are essential parts of website headers. Contact information, copyright information, legal connections, extra navigation, and accessibility features are often found in footers. These elements improve the website's overall consistency, branding, and usability.
- What technology used and how it is used
<br /> Website headers and footers are constructed with CSS for styling and HTML for structure. These parts are defined by HTML tags such as <header> and <footer>, and their look, layout, and responsiveness are controlled by CSS. This approach ensures consistent branding, navigation, and information presentation throughout webpages.

## Rules, Practices and Principles
1. Always use `WD-` in the front of the Title of the Project for the Subject followed by your custom naming.
2. Do not rename any .html files; always use `index.html` as the filename.
3. Place Files in their respective folders.
4. All file naming are in camel case.
   - Camel case is naming format where there is no white space in separation of each words, the first word is in all lower case while the succeding words first letter are in upper followed by lower cased letters.
   - ex.: buttonAnimatedStyle.css
5. Use only `External CSS`.
6. Renaming of Pages folder names are a must, and relates to what it is doing or data it holding.
7. File Structure to follow below.

```
